    <p>Welcome to my corner of the digital world! I'm Brielle Broadt, a recent graduate of the Rutgers University Coding Bootcamp, 
        Where I successfully earned my certificate as a Full stack Web Developer. Stepping into the world of web development
        has been an exciting journey. Throughout the bootcamp I had the opportunity to work on diverse
        challanges and projects that are displayed below.
